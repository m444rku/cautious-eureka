        The Samsung Galaxy S21 is a series of Android-based smartphones designed, developed, marketed, and manufactured
        by Samsung Electronics as part of its Galaxy S series. They collectively serve as the successor to the Galaxy
        S20 series. <br>
        The lineup comprises three devices, with the Galaxy S21 being the least expensive with a smaller screen size. In
        contrast to the Galaxy S20+, the Galaxy S21+ is very similar to the S21 spec-wise, with the exception of a
        larger display, higher battery capacity, and back glass instead of plastic. The Galaxy S21 Ultra has an even
        larger screen size, battery, and a host of other improvements over the other models, including a more advanced
        camera setup highlighted by its 108 MP main sensor with laser auto-focus and a higher resolution 1440p
        display.The S21 Ultra is also the first phone in the Galaxy S series to support the S Pen, albeit sold
        separately and with limited functionality. <br>
        The Galaxy S21 series has a design similar to its predecessor, with an Infinity-O display containing a circular
        cutout in the top center for the front selfie camera. The S21's back panel is reinforced poly-carbonate similar
        to the S20 FE and Note 20, while the S21+ and S21 Ultra use glass. The rear camera array has been integrated
        into the phone body and has a metallic surround; the S21 Ultra has a carbon fiber camera surround for exclusive
        colors. <br>

        Hardware <br>
        Chipsets <br>
        The S21 line comprises three models with various hardware specifications. International and Korea models of the
        S21 utilize the Exynos system-on-chip, while the U.S., Canadian, Chinese, Taiwanese, Hong Kong and Japanese
        models utilize the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888. <br>
        Display <br>
        The S21 series feature "Dynamic AMOLED 2X" displays with HDR10+ support and "dynamic tone mapping" technology.
        All models utilize a second-generation ultrasonic in-screen fingerprint sensor. The S21 Ultra is also now able
        to use 120hz at 1440p unlike its predecessor. <br>
        The S21 and S21+ offer 8 GB of RAM with 128 GB and 256 GB options for internal storage. The S21 Ultra has 12 GB
        of RAM with 128 GB and 256 GB options as well as a 16 GB option with 512 GB of internal storage. All three
        models
        lack a microSD card slot, which was present on the S20 series.
        The S21, S21+, and S21 Ultra contain non-removable 4000 mAh, 4800 mAh, and 5000 mAh Li-Po batteries
        respectively.
        All three models support wired charging over USB-C at up to 25W (using USB Power Delivery) as well as Qi
        inductive
        charging up to 15W. The phones also have the ability to charge other Qi-compatible devices from the S21's own
        battery power,
        which is branded as "Wireless PowerShare," at up to 4.5W.
        All the three phones support 5G SA/NSA networks, The Galaxy S21 and S21+ support Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0,
        while the Galaxy S21 Ultra
        supports Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2. The S21+ and S21 Ultra models also support Ultra Wideband (UWB) for
        short-range communications similar
        to NFC (not to be confused with 5G mmWave, which is marketed as Ultra Wideband by Verizon). Samsung uses this
        technology for their new
        "SmartThings Find" feature and the upcoming Samsung Galaxy SmartTag+. <br> <br><br><br><br>
