        The iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc. that use Apple's iOS mobile operating
        system. The first-generation iPhone was announced by former Apple CEO Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007. Since then
        Apple has annually released new iPhone models and iOS updates. As of November 1, 2018, more than 2.2 billion
        iPhones had been sold.

        The iPhone has a user interface built around a multi-touch screen. It connects to cellular networks or Wi-Fi,
        and can make calls, browse the web, take pictures, play music and send and receive emails and text messages.
        Since the iPhone's launch further features have been added, including larger screen sizes, shooting video,
        waterproofing, the ability to install third-party mobile apps through an app store, and many accessibility
        features. Up to 2017, iPhones used a layout with a single button on the front panel that returns the user to the
        home screen. Since 2017, more expensive iPhone models have switched to a nearly bezel-less front screen design
        with app switching activated by gesture recognition.

        The iPhone is one of the two largest smartphone platforms in the world alongside Android, forming a large part
        of the luxury market. The iPhone has generated large profits for Apple, making it one of the world's most
        valuable publicly traded companies. The first-generation iPhone was described as "revolutionary" and a
        "game-changer" for the mobile phone industry and subsequent models have also garnered praise. The iPhone has
        been credited with popularizing the smartphone and slate form factor, and with creating a large market for
        smartphone apps, or "app economy". As of January 2017, Apple's App Store contained more than 2.2 million
        applications for the iPhone. <br>
        Development of what was to become the iPhone began in 2004, when Apple started to gather a team of 1,000
        employees led by hardware engineer Tony Fadell, software engineer Scott Forstall and design engineer Sir
        Jonathan Ive[15] to work on the highly confidential "Project Purple."[16][17]

        Apple CEO Steve Jobs steered the original focus away from a tablet (which Apple eventually revisited in the form
        of the iPad) towards a phone.[18] Apple created the device during a secretive collaboration with Cingular
        Wireless (which became AT&T Mobility) at the timeâ€”at an estimated development cost of US$150 million over thirty
        months.[19]

        According to Steve Jobs, the "i" word in "iMac" (and therefore "iPod", "iPhone" and "iPad") stands for internet,
        individual, instruct, inform, and inspire.[20][21]

        Apple rejected the "design by committee" approach that had yielded the Motorola ROKR E1, a largely unsuccessful
        collaboration with Motorola. Among other deficiencies, the ROKR E1's firmware limited storage to only 100 iTunes
        songs to avoid competing with Apple's iPod nano.[22][23]

        Cingular gave Apple the liberty to develop the iPhone's hardware and software in-house[24][25] and even paid
        Apple a fraction of its monthly service revenue (until the iPhone 3G),[26] in exchange for four years of
        exclusive U.S. sales, until 2011.[27]

        Jobs unveiled the iPhone to the public on January 9, 2007, at the Macworld 2007 convention at the Moscone Center
        in San Francisco.[28] The two initial models, a 4 GB[a] model priced at US$499 and an 8 GB model at US$599 (both
        requiring a two-year contract), went on sale in the United States on June 29, 2007, at 6:00 pm local time, while
        hundreds of customers lined up outside the stores nationwide.[29] The passionate reaction to the launch of the
        iPhone resulted in sections of the media dubbing it the 'Jesus phone'.[30][31] Following this successful release
        in the US, the first generation iPhone was made available in the UK, France, and Germany in November 2007, and
        Ireland and Austria in the spring of 2008.

        On Tuesday, September 27, Apple sent invitations for a press event to be held October 4, 2011, at 10:00 am at
        the Cupertino headquarters to announce details of the next generation iPhone, which turned out to be iPhone 4S.
        Over 1 million 4S models were sold in the first 24 hours after its release in October 2011.[41] Due to large
        volumes of the iPhone being manufactured and its high selling price, Apple became the largest mobile handset
        vendor in the world by revenue, in 2011, surpassing long-time leader Nokia.[42] American carrier C Spire
        Wireless announced that it would be carrying the iPhone 4S on October 19, 2011.[43]

        In January 2012, Apple reported its best quarterly earnings ever, with 53% of its revenue coming from the sale
        of 37 million iPhones, at an average selling price of nearly $660. The average selling price has remained fairly
        constant for most of the phone's lifespan, hovering between $622 and $660.[44] The production price of the
        iPhone 4S was estimated by IHS iSuppli, in October 2011, to be $188, $207 and $245, for the 16 GB, 32 GB and 64
        GB models, respectively.[45] Labor costs are estimated at between $12.50 and $30 per unit, with workers on the
        iPhone assembly line making $1.78 an hour.[46]

        In February 2012, ComScore reported that 12.4% of U.S. mobile subscribers used an iPhone.[47] Approximately 6.4
        million iPhones are active in the U.S. alone.[35]

        On September 12, 2012, Apple announced the iPhone 5. It has a 4 inches (100 mm) display, up from its
        predecessors' 3.5 inches (89 mm) screen. The device comes with the same 326 pixels per inch found in the iPhone
        4 and 4S. The iPhone 5 has the SoC A6 processor, the chip is 22% smaller than the iPhone 4S' A5 and is twice as
        fast, doubling the graphics performance of its predecessor. The device is 18% thinner than the iPhone 4S,
        measuring 7.6 millimetres (0.3 in), and is 20% lighter at 112 grams (4 oz).

        On July 6, 2013, it was reported that Apple was in talks with Korean mobile carrier SK Telecom to release the
        next generation iPhone with LTE Advanced technology.[48]

        On July 22, 2013, the company's suppliers said that Apple is testing out larger screens for the iPhone and iPad.
        "Apple has asked for prototype smartphone screens larger than 4 inches (100 mm) and has also asked for screen
        designs for a new tablet device measuring slightly less than 13 inches (330 mm) diagonally, they said."[49]

        On September 10, 2013, Apple unveiled two new iPhone models during a press event in Cupertino. The iPhone 5C, a
        mid-range-priced version of the handset that is designed to increase accessibility due to its price is available
        in five colors (green, blue, yellow, pink, and white) and is made of plastic. The iPhone 5S comes in three
        colors (black, white, and gold) and the home button is replaced with a fingerprint scanner (Touch ID). Both
        phones shipped on September 20, 2013.[50]

        On September 9, 2014, Apple revealed the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus at an event in Cupertino. Both devices
        had a larger screen than their predecessor, at 4.7 inches (120 mm) and 5.5 inches (140 mm) respectively.[51]

        After the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus was released, some users started complaining about the 6 and 6 Plus bending from
        normal use. This trend became known as "Bendgate",[52] which later started "Touch Disease." However, they
        released the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, a more bend ressistant iPhone than the 6 and 6 Plus, to solve this issue.

        On September 7, 2016, Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, which added water and dust resistance, improved
        system and graphics performance, a new dual-camera setup on the Plus model, new color options, and featured the
        removal of the 3.5 mm headphone jack from the iPhone.[53]

        On September 12, 2017, Apple officially unveiled the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which features a new glass design,
        camera improvements, a True Tone display, wireless charging, and improved system performance. It also unveiled
        the iPhone X, which features a near bezel-less design, a facial recognition feature dubbed "Face ID" with facial
        tracking used for Animojis, an OLED screen with the highest pixel density on an iPhone, a new telephoto lens
        which works better in low light conditions, and improved cameras for AR.[54]

        On September 12, 2018, Apple officially unveiled the iPhone XS, XS Max[55] and XR[56] at the Steve Jobs theater
        at Apple Park. The XS and XS Max feature an improved Super Retina Display with Dolby Vision and HDR10 support
        with the XS Max featuring a larger 6.5 inches (170 mm) display, improved cameras with Smart HDR, and the A12
        Bionic chip. The iPhone XS and XS Max are IP68 water, liquid, and dust resistant which allow the devices to be
        submerged in up to 2 meters for a duration of 30 minutes, while iPhone XR retained the IP67 certification found
        in the first-generation iPhone X and also features an IPS LCD display instead of the OLED displays found in the
        higher-end models. The iPhone XS/XS Max's IP68 certifications were tested using various liquids such as
        chlorinated-water, saltwater, tea, wine, beer, and juices. Apple also announced the fourth generation of Apple
        Watch, the Apple Watch Series 4.

        On September 10, 2019, Apple officially unveiled the iPhone 11 at Steve Jobs Theater,[57][58][59] along with the
        iPhone 11 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max.[60][61][59]

        The iPhone 12 and 12 Pro series were virtually announced on October 13, 2020, featuring a refreshed design,
        Super Retina XDR Displays across all models, and 5G connectivity.
