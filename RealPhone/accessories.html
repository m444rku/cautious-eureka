        A smartphone is a portable device that combines mobile telephone and computing functions into one unit. They are
        distinguished from feature phones by their stronger hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating
        systems, which facilitate wider software, internet (including web browsing over mobile broadband), and
        multimedia functionality (including music, video, cameras, and gaming), alongside core phone functions such as
        voice calls and text messaging. Smartphones typically contain a number of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS)
        integrated circuit (IC) chips, include various sensors that can be leveraged by pre-included and third-party
        software (such as a magnetometer, proximity sensors, barometer, gyroscope, accelerometer and more), and support
        wireless communications protocols (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or satellite navigation).
        <br>
        Early smartphones were marketed primarily towards the enterprise market, attempting to bridge the functionality
        of standalone personal digital assistant (PDA) devices with support for cellular telephony, but were limited by
        their bulky form, short battery life, slow analog cellular networks, and the immaturity of wireless data
        services. These issues were eventually resolved with the exponential scaling and miniaturization of MOS
        transistors down to sub-micron levels (Moore's law), the improved lithium-ion battery, faster digital mobile
        data networks (Edholm's law), and more mature software platforms that allowed mobile device ecosystems to
        develop independently of data providers.
        <br>
        In the 2000s, NTT DoCoMo's i-mode platform, BlackBerry, Nokia's Symbian platform, and Windows Mobile began to
        gain market traction, with models often featuring QWERTY keyboards or resistive touchscreen input, and
        emphasizing access to push email and wireless internet. Following the rising popularity of the iPhone in the
        late 2000s, the majority of smartphones have featured thin, slate-like form factors, with large, capacitive
        screens with support for multi-touch gestures rather than physical keyboards, and offer the ability for users to
        download or purchase additional applications from a centralized store, and use cloud storage and
        synchronization, virtual assistants, as well as mobile payment services. Smartphones have largely replaced PDAs
        and handheld/palm-sized PCs.
        <br>
        Improved hardware and faster wireless communication (due to standards such as LTE) have bolstered the growth of
        the smartphone industry. In the third quarter of 2012, one billion smartphones were in use worldwide.[1] Global
        smartphone sales surpassed the sales figures for feature phones in early 2013
        <br>
        The development of the smartphone was enabled by several key technological advances. The exponential scaling and
        miniaturization of MOSFETs (MOS transistors) down to sub-micron levels during the 1990s–2000s (as predicted by
        Moore's law) made it possible to build portable smart devices such as smartphones,[3][4][5] as well as enabling
        the transition from analog to faster digital wireless mobile networks (leading to Edholm's law).[6][7][8] Other
        important enabling factors include the lithium-ion battery, an indispensable energy source enabling long battery
        life,[9] invented in the 1980s[10] and commercialized in 1991,[11] and the development of more mature software
        platforms that allowed mobile device ecosystems to develop independently of data providers. <br>
        In the early 1990s, IBM engineer Frank Canova realised that chip-and-wireless technology was becoming small
        enough to use in handheld devices.[13] The first commercially available device that could be properly referred
        to as a "smartphone" began as a prototype called "Angler" developed by Canova in 1992 while at IBM and
        demonstrated in November of that year at the COMDEX computer industry trade show.[14][15][16] A refined version
        was marketed to consumers in 1994 by BellSouth under the name Simon Personal Communicator. In addition to
        placing and receiving cellular calls, the touchscreen-equipped Simon could send and receive faxes and emails. It
        included an address book, calendar, appointment scheduler, calculator, world time clock, and notepad, as well as
        other visionary mobile applications such as maps, stock reports and news.[17]

        The IBM Simon was manufactured by Mitsubishi Electric, which integrated features from its own wireless personal
        digital assistant (PDA) and cellular radio technologies.[18] It featured a liquid-crystal display (LCD) and PC
        Card support.[19] The Simon was commercially unsuccessful, particularly due to its bulky form factor and limited
        battery life,[20] using NiCad batteries rather than the nickel–metal hydride batteries commonly used in mobile
        phones in the 1990s, or lithium-ion batteries used in modern smartphones.[21]

        The term "smart phone" was not coined until a year after the introduction of the Simon, appearing in print as
        early as 1995, describing AT&T's PhoneWriter Communicator.[22][non-primary source needed] The term "smartphone"
        was first used by Ericsson in 1997 to describe a new device concept, the GS88.[23]
        <br>
        Beginning in the mid-late 1990s, many people who had mobile phones carried a separate dedicated PDA device,
        running early versions of operating systems such as Palm OS, Newton OS, Symbian or Windows CE/Pocket PC. These
        operating systems would later evolve into early mobile operating systems. Most of the "smartphones" in this era
        were hybrid devices that combined these existing familiar PDA OSes with basic phone hardware. The results were
        devices that were bulkier than either dedicated mobile phones or PDAs, but allowed a limited amount of cellular
        Internet access. PDA and mobile phone manufacturers competed in reducing the size of devices. The bulk of these
        smartphones combined with their high cost and expensive data plans, plus other drawbacks such as expansion
        limitations and decreased battery life compared to separate standalone devices, generally limited their
        popularity to "early adopters" and business users who needed portable connectivity.

        In March 1996, Hewlett-Packard released the OmniGo 700LX, a modified HP 200LX palmtop PC with a Nokia 2110
        mobile phone piggybacked onto it and ROM-based software to support it. It had a 640×200 resolution CGA
        compatible four-shade gray-scale LCD screen and could be used to place and receive calls, and to create and
        receive text messages, emails and faxes. It was also 100% DOS 5.0 compatible, allowing it to run thousands of
        existing software titles, including early versions of Windows.

        In August 1996, Nokia released the Nokia 9000 Communicator, a digital cellular PDA based on the Nokia 2110 with
        an integrated system based on the PEN/GEOS 3.0 operating system from Geoworks. The two components were attached
        by a hinge in what became known as a clamshell design, with the display above and a physical QWERTY keyboard
        below. The PDA provided e-mail; calendar, address book, calculator and notebook applications; text-based Web
        browsing; and could send and receive faxes. When closed, the device could be used as a digital cellular
        telephone.

        In June 1999 Qualcomm released the "pdQ Smartphone", a CDMA digital PCS smartphone with an integrated Palm PDA
        and Internet connectivity.[24]

        Subsequent landmark devices included:

        The Ericsson R380 (December 2000)[25] by Ericsson Mobile Communications,[26] the first phone running the
        operating system later named Symbian (it ran EPOC Release 5, which was renamed Symbian OS at Release 6). It had
        PDA functionality and limited Web browsing on a resistive touchscreen utilizing a stylus.[27] While it was
        marketed as a "smartphone",[28] users could not install their own software on the device.
        The Kyocera 6035 (February 2001),[29] a dual-nature device with a separate Palm OS PDA operating system and CDMA
        mobile phone firmware. It supported limited Web browsing with the PDA software treating the phone hardware as an
        attached modem.[30][31]
        The Nokia 9210 Communicator (June 2001),[32] the first phone running Symbian (Release 6) with Nokia's Series 80
        platform (v1.0). This was the first Symbian phone platform allowing the installation of additional applications.
        Like the Nokia 9000 Communicator it's a large clamshell device with a full physical QWERTY keyboard inside.
        Handspring's Treo 180 (2002), the first smartphone that fully integrated the Palm OS on a GSM mobile phone
        having telephony, SMS messaging and Internet access built into the OS. The 180 model had a thumb-type keyboard
        and the 180g version had a Graffiti handwriting recognition area, instead.[33]
