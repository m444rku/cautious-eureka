        The Samsung Group (or simply Samsung) (Korean: 삼성) is a South Korean multinational manufacturing conglomerate
        headquartered in Samsung Town, Seoul, South Korea. It comprises numerous affiliated businesses, most of
        them united under the Samsung brand, and is the largest South Korean chaebol (business conglomerate). As of
        2020, Samsung has the 8th highest global brand value.

        Samsung was founded by Lee Byung-chul in 1938 as a trading company. Over the next three decades, the group
        diversified into areas including food processing, textiles, insurance, securities, and retail. Samsung entered
        the electronics industry in the late 1960s and the construction and shipbuilding industries in the mid-1970s;
        these areas would drive its subsequent growth. Following Lee's death in 1987, Samsung was separated into five
        business groups – Samsung Group, Shinsegae Group, CJ Group and Hansol Group, and Joongang Group.

        Notable Samsung industrial affiliates include Samsung Electronics (the world's largest information technology
        company, consumer electronics maker and chipmaker measured by 2017 revenues), Samsung Heavy Industries
        (the world's 2nd largest shipbuilder measured by 2010 revenues),[ and Samsung Engineering and Samsung C&T
        Corporation (respectively the world's 13th and 36th largest construction companies). Other notable
        subsidiaries include Samsung Life Insurance (the world's 14th largest life insurance company), Samsung
        Everland (operator of Everland Resort, the oldest theme park in South Korea) and Cheil Worldwide (the
        world's 15th largest advertising agency, as measured by 2012 revenues). <br>
        1938–1970

        Lee Byung-chul, founder of Samsung
        In 1938, during Japanese-ruled Korea, Lee Byung-chul (1910–1987) of a large landowning family in the Uiryeong
        county moved to nearby Daegu city and founded Mitsuboshi Trading Company (株式会社三星商会 (Kabushiki gaisha Mitsuboshi
        Shōkai)), or Samsung Sanghoe (주식회사 삼성상회). Samsung started out as a small trading company with forty employees
        located in Su-dong (now Ingyo-dong). It dealt in dried-fish,[16] locally-grown groceries and noodles. The
        company prospered and Lee moved its head office to Seoul in 1947. When the Korean War broke out, he was forced
        to leave Seoul. He started a sugar refinery in Busan named Cheil Jedang. In 1954, Lee founded Cheil Mojik and
        built the plant in Chimsan-dong, Daegu. It was the largest woollen mill ever in the country.[citation needed]

        Samsung diversified into many different areas. Lee sought to establish Samsung as a leader in a wide range of
        industries. Samsung moved into lines of business such as insurance, securities, and retail.

        In 1947, Cho Hong-jai, the Hyosung group's founder, jointly invested in a new company called Samsung Mulsan
        Gongsa, or the Samsung Trading Corporation, with the Samsung's founder Lee Byung-chull. The trading firm grew to
        become the present-day Samsung C&T Corporation. After a few years, Cho and Lee separated due to differences in
        management style. Cho wanted a 30 equity share. Samsung Group was separated into Samsung Group and Hyosung
        Group, Hankook Tire and other businesses.

        In the late 1960s, Samsung Group entered the electronics industry. It formed several electronics-related
        divisions, such as Samsung Electronics Devices, Samsung Electro-Mechanics, Samsung Corning and Samsung
        Semiconductor & Telecommunications, and made the facility in Suwon. Its first product was a black-and-white
        television set. <br>
        In 1980, Samsung acquired the Gumi-based Hanguk Jeonja Tongsin and entered telecommunications hardware. Its
        early products were switchboards. The facility was developed into the telephone and fax manufacturing systems
        and became the center of Samsung's mobile phone manufacturing. They have produced over 800 million mobile phones
        to date. The company grouped them together under Samsung Electronics in the 1980s.

        After Lee, the founder's death in 1987, Samsung Group was separated into five business groups—Samsung Group,
        Shinsegae Group, CJ Group, Hansol Group and the JoongAng Group. Shinsegae (discount store, department store)
        was originally part of Samsung Group, separated in the 1990s from the Samsung Group along with CJ Group
        (Food/Chemicals/Entertainment/logistics), Hansol Group (Paper/Telecom), and the JoongAng Group (Media). Today
        these separated groups are independent and they are not part of or connected to the Samsung Group. One
        Hansol Group representative said, "Only people ignorant of the laws governing the business world could believe
        something so absurd", adding, "When Hansol separated from the Samsung Group in 1991, it severed all payment
        guarantees and share-holding ties with Samsung affiliates." One Hansol Group source asserted, "Hansol,
        Shinsegae, and CJ have been under independent management since their respective separations from the Samsung
        Group". One Shinsegae department store executive director said, "Shinsegae has no payment guarantees associated
        with the Samsung Group".

        In the 1980s, Samsung Electronics began to invest heavily in research and development, investments that were
        pivotal in pushing the company to the forefront of the global electronics industry. In 1982, it built a
        television assembly plant in Portugal; in 1984, a plant in New York; in 1985, a plant in Tokyo; in 1987, a
        facility in England; and another facility in Austin, Texas, in 1996. As of 2012, Samsung has invested more than
        US$13,000,000,000 in the Austin facility, which operates under the name Samsung Austin Semiconductor. This makes
        the Austin location the largest foreign investment in Texas and one of the largest single foreign investments in
        the United States.

        In 1987, United States International Trade Commission order that the Samsung Group of South Korea unlawfully
        sold computer chips in the United States without licenses from the chip inventor, Texas Instruments Inc. The
        order requires Samsung to pay a penalty to Texas Instruments within the coming weeks. Otherwise, sales of all
        dynamic random access memory chips made by Samsung and all products using the chips would be banned in the
        United States. The ban includes circuit boards and equipment called single-in-line packages made by other
        companies that use D-RAM's made by Samsung with 64,000 or 256,000 characters of memory. It also covers
        computers, facsimile machines and certain telecommunications equipment and printers bearing either of the
        Samsung chips. <br>
        Since 1990, Samsung has increasingly globalised its activities and electronics; in particular, its mobile phones
        and semiconductors have become its most important source of income. It was in this period that Samsung started
        to rise as an international corporation in the 1990s. Samsung's construction branch was awarded contracts to
        build one of the two Petronas Towers in Malaysia, Taipei 101 in Taiwan and the Burj Khalifa in United Arab
        Emirates. In 1993, Lee Kun-hee sold off ten of Samsung Group's subsidiaries, downsized the company, and
        merged other operations to concentrate on three industries: electronics, engineering and chemicals. In 1996, the
        Samsung Group reacquired the Sungkyunkwan University foundation.

        Samsung became the world's largest producer of memory chips in 1992 and is the world's second-largest chipmaker
        after Intel (see Worldwide Top 20 Semiconductor Market Share Ranking Year by Year). In 1995, it created its
        first liquid-crystal display screen. Ten years later, Samsung grew to be the world's largest manufacturer of
        liquid-crystal display panels. Sony, which had not invested in large-size TFT-LCDs, contacted Samsung to
        cooperate, and, in 2006, S-LCD was established as a joint venture between Samsung and Sony in order to provide a
        stable supply of LCD panels for both manufacturers. S-LCD was owned by Samsung (50% plus one share) and Sony
        (50% minus one share) and operates its factories and facilities in Tanjung, South Korea. As of 26 December 2011,
        it was announced that Samsung had acquired the stake of Sony in this joint venture.

        Compared to other major Korean companies, Samsung survived the 1997 Asian financial crisis relatively unharmed.
        However, Samsung Motor was sold to Renault at a significant loss. As of 2010, Renault Samsung is 80.1 percent
        owned by Renault and 19.9 percent owned by Samsung. Additionally, Samsung manufactured a range of aircraft from
        the 1980s to the 1990s. The company was founded in 1999 as Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI), the result of a
        merger between then three domestic major aerospace divisions of Samsung Aerospace, Daewoo Heavy Industries and
        Hyundai Space and Aircraft Company. However, Samsung still manufactures aircraft engines and gas turbines. <br>
